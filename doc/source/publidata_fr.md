# Publidata — provider for waste management schedules

Support for schedules provided by [Publidata](https://www.publidata.io/fr/).

They operate the schedules of at least the following communities:

- GPSEO
- Orléans Métropole
- Tours Métropole
- Versailles Grand Parc
- Saint Quentin en Yvelines
- Saumur Val de Loire
- Châteauroux Métropole

A pre-configuration is provided for the above communities. But you have the possibility to
use this generic implementation for more if they are operated by Publidata, the only additional
information you need is your community’s "instance id".

Example about how to get it (for GPSEO, adapt with your community’s dedicated widget page):

- go to <https://infos-dechets.gpseo.fr/>
- provide a random address
- open your browser’s network inspector
- refresh the page
- filter the queries for "api.publidata"
- the first call should be something like <https://api.publidata.io/v2/search?types[]=Platform::Services::AdministrativeProcedure&size=1000&instances[]=1294>

In that case your instance ID is 1294.

If collection data is available for the address provided, it will return waste collection dates.

## Configuration via configuration.yaml

```yaml
waste_collection_schedule:
    sources:
    - name: dechets_gpseo_fr
      args:
        address: "ADDRESS"
        insee_code: "INSEE_CODE"
        instance_id: "1294"
```

### Configuration Variables
